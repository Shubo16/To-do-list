# extra notes, details

---
- Hardest part of this project was understanding where i needed to incorporate the sql commands and what to use from the ejs file with that, it took me a while but after looking at previous examples from the family trackers, I understood what i needed to take from each section of the form.

## What I have created

---

- This time I've decided to create a to-do list that is saved using the local database using pgadmin and postgresql commands. The web application has a simple set of actions: add, delete, edit and view items on our to do list.
- This has been created using index.ejs, pgadmin, css

## Feedback, general ideas to improve work

---

- Instead of using plain css, maybe try use tailwind instead
- add animations instead it staying static
